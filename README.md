# hello-classroom

## Introduction
This repository is meant to be a quick guide to deploying a Github Classroom in support of classes at [Binghamton University](https://www.binghamton.edu/computer-science/index.html), although instructors at other institutions may find it useful.

To see what a repository for use as assignment starter code looks like, ~~[visit this repository](https://github.com/bucs220/hello-classroom).~~ **See issue [#1](https://github.com/colematt/hello-classroom/issues/1)**

To see what an assignment based on that repository looks like, ~~accept this assignment~~ **See issue [#1](https://github.com/colematt/hello-classroom/issues/1)**

This repository -- although public -- is not meant to be useful to students. _Please do not direct students not serving as assistants to this repository_ for help with Git or Github. I am not the Binghamton University [GitHub Campus Expert](https://githubcampus.expert/).
